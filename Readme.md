## 3️⃣ How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the pipeline:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

3. View the Streamlit dashboard:
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```

## 4️⃣ Live Outputs

- **Google Sheet**: [View Live Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19Kpm88NnI0EZ4G_nNHJzXgBuGdNoPTSA4IQ1yQ8D_zw/edit)
- **Streamlit Dashboard**: Run locally with `streamlit run streamlit_app.py`

## 5️⃣ Assumptions

- **Mock Data**: Uses sample data in `data/ranked_leads.json`
- **No Web Scraping**: Static data only, no live LinkedIn/web scraping
- **Reproducible Design**: Deterministic pipeline with pinned dependencies
- **Service Account**: Uses Google Sheets API with service account authentication
